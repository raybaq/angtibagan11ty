I have written a number of first posts, on this, that or other blogging platform over the years.  Perhaps that is just to be expected, as I similarly started, and failed to keep up, a diary or journal. 

## Why this time is different

I picked up this domain (lifelonglearning.online) at Namecheap's Black Friday sale last year.  I think it's so appropriate for our world now in the midst of a pandemic, and afterwards.  Its what I've been doing (off and on) since I retired (with a hiatus or two for travel).

I've been getting more into the swing of things since the catechetical year ended and the lockdown for the pandemic began, trying out things on IBM cloud, and then also Google cloud following Google's Cloud Onboarding online workshop that coincided with the start of the lockdown. I haven't gotten much beyond "Hello World" on those platforms though.

On the other hand I re-experienced how easy it was to get a site up on Netlify when I did [Eric Normand's course](https://purelyfunctional.tv/courses/markdown-editor/), so I picked [one of the static site generators that work well with Netlify](https://www.11ty.dev/) and got a blog up in minutes.

So, the combination of having a lot of time to spend learning online and the reduced friction in getting results (whether its a writing project or software development) means I can keep doing this in the near future.  A good thing, because there is a mountain of technical debt that I'm chipping away at.
