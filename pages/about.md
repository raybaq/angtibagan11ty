My first experience programming a computer consisted of writing FORTRAN code on a form which I then handed to a keypunch operator through a window in a glass partition to be keyed onto punch cards, one line of 80 characters or less per card. After verifying that everything was correctly coded I handed my deck of cards (merged with a couple of control cards and some data cards) to the system operator of the IBM mainframe.  If all went well I would get my deck back along with a few pages of printout with a program listing and the output of my program.

That's a far cry from the computing environment of today where the laptop I am typing on and even the phone in my pocket are computers far more powerful than that old IBM 360, and where writing software involves pullling in code from numerous contributors from all over a world-wide network, combining with a few lines of code that I write myself, and ending up with software that can run locally on my laptop or phone or on that same world-wide netowrk.

It's been quite a journey, one that I wish I had started writing about sooner.  Oh, I have started writing many times before but could never keep it going.  I'm hoping that this time will be different.
